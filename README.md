# dsva-firewall-tester
Ruby code to test incidents when the VA firewall rejects binary pdf uploads but returns a 200 status

I don't include the apikey in the code but you can sign up for your own [Benefits Intake API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits?version=current) key at https://developer.va.gov/apply

Example run and output for test script.

The goal here was to capture instances where the VA Firewall returned an error with a 200 closed response and in HTML instead of requested JSON type as well as make it easil replicatable for anyone wanting to try it out.
